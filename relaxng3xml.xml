        <stanza n="1">Every October it becomes important, no, necessary to see the <nature n="1"
                >leaves</nature> turning, to be surrounded by <nature n="2">leaves</nature> turning;
            it's not just the symbolism, to confront in the death of the year your death, one
            blazing farewell appearance, though the irony isn't lost on you that nature is most
            seductive when it's about to die, flaunting the dazzle of its incipient exit, an ending
            that at least so far the effects of human progress <nature n="3">(pollution, acid
                rain)</nature> have not yet frightened you enough to make you believe is real; that
            is, you know this ending is a deception because of course nature is always renewing
            itself— the <nature n="4">trees</nature> don't die, they just pretend, go out in style,
            and return in style: a new style. </stanza> &amp; 
        <stanza n="2">Is it deliberate how far
            they make you go especially if you live in the city to get far enough away from home to
            see not just <nature n="1">trees</nature> but only <nature n="2">trees</nature>? The
            boring highways, roadsigns, high speeds, 10-axle trucks passing you as if they were in
            an even greater hurry than you to look at <nature n="3">leaves</nature>: so you drive in
            terror for literal hours and it looks like <nature n="4">rain</nature>, or <nature n="5"
                >snow</nature>, but it's probably just <nature n="5">clouds</nature> (too cloudy to
            see any color?) and you wonder, given the poverty of your memory, which road had the
            most color last year, but it doesn't matter since you're probably too late anyway, or
            too early— whichever road you take will be the wrong one and you've probably come all
            this way for nothing.</stanza> <!-- practicing an XML comment -->
        <stanza n="3">You'll be driving along depressed when suddenly a <nature n="1">cloud</nature>
            will move and the <nature n="2">sun</nature> will muscle through and ignite the <nature
                n="3">hills</nature>. It may not last. Probably won't last. But for a moment the
            whole <nature n="4">world</nature> comes to. Wakes up. Proves it lives. It lives— red,
            yellow, orange, brown, russet, ocher, vermilion, gold. Flame and rust. Flame and rust,
            the permutations of burning. You're on <nature n="5">fire</nature>. Your eyes are on
            fire. It won't last, you don't want it to last. You can't stand any more. But you don't
            want it to stop. It's what you've come for. It's what you'll come back for. It won't
            stay with you, but you'll remember that it felt like nothing else you've felt or
            something you've felt that also didn't last.</stanza>
